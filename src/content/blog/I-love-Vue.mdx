title: I Love Vue

As a longtime developer building with Vue2, I've tried out Vue3 a handful of times and it never really clicked. I think the problem was I was trying to build a basic admin system with it, and thought "I could do everything easier in Vue2". But now that I'm making a more complex app (a web-based TikTok clone for work), it's finally starting to click how using the Composition API is a nice thing to have. I'm still getting used to TypeScript, Pinia is easier to use now (much less boilerplate), and Vite is fast!

I'd post some examples here, but 1) I'm lazy and 2) I'm noticing a trend of the same articles being posted under different names. Not sure if this is a thing to get more cred for potential job hires, but I don't want to get my stuff scraped. Or even worse, stolen and republished by an AI bot ðŸ¤–.
