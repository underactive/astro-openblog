title: Streaming multiple audio channels on AppleTV
---

Just an idea that could be useful and should(?) be technically possible with streaming boxes with compute power:

The ability to stream different audio channels on different audio outputs.

For example, my gf wants to watch a Netflix program with Swedish audio and English subtitles; however, I want to get some work done on my laptop and watch the show in the background. I can't commit to reading subs so it would be cool if I could put on my AirPods and listen to the English-dubbed audio.

In other words, one audio stream on the HDMI output, and another stream on Bluetooth. Make this happen, Tim Apple!
