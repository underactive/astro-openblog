Made some updates to this layout by adding a couple new SVG icons to the header, thanks to my girlfriend telling me about [SVGViewer](https://www.svgviewer.dev/). I thought doing this stuff required some expensive Adobe product but it's free and just required some small tweaking to get it to work with the light/dark mode switching.

Also added Astro's Vue integration and to start, converted the Footer component from Astro to Vue. Easy stuff, and tbh the .astro version was smaller but the more complicated JSX-y stuff will make more sense to me once I convert it.
