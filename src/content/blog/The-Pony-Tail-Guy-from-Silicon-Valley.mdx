When I was at work today washing my hands in the restroom, and looking in the mirror I saw the juxtaposition of a pepper-haired me and my work badge featuring a more babyfaced version of myself from 2003. I realized I'm becoming the real-life version of a minor character in [Silicon Valley](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/) (2014).

I don't know if anyone else realized this minor detail ([someone else on reddit did](https://www.reddit.com/r/SiliconValleyHBO/comments/4miicf/something_i_noticed_about_pony_tail_guy_in_s03e03/)), but one of the "basement IT" guys in the show wore a work badge that revealed a much younger version of himself:

It's been a while. I should give that show another watch üì∫üçø.
